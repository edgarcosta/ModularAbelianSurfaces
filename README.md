# ModularAbelianSurfaces

Code and data on how to associate in practice a classical modular form of weight 2, dimension 2, and trivial (perhaps quadratic at some point) nebentypus to all genus 2 curve of GL2 type whose Jacobians are Q-isogenous to the modular abelian varieties (sub and quotient) associated to f.

# This is a work in progress!
